Deepfake Analyzer
The Deepfake Analyzer is a simple web application that allows users to upload two images and determine whether they are real or fake using a pre-trained machine learning model. This project aims to provide a demonstration of image classification using Flask, PyTorch, and basic web development technologies.

Introduction
Deepfake technology has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital media. This project showcases a basic implementation of a deepfake detection system. By uploading two images, the system uses a pre-trained PyTorch model to determine whether each image is real or fake. The results are displayed on a web interface.

Features
Upload two images for analysis.
Get instant results on whether the images are classified as real or fake.
Modern user interface using Flask and Bootstrap.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Flask
PyTorch
torchvision
Pillow
Getting Started
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-analyzer.git
cd deepfake-analyzer
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the Deepfake Analyzer.

Upload two images using the provided form. The system will analyze and classify the images as real or fake.
